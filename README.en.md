- Clone the created repository and copy the previous work files into it.
- Add animated decorative effects to layout pages of
  [**homework #5**](https://www.figma.com/file/5vQ5fIsm5p6Mfqhl0Ee2qB/Web-Studio-ENG?node-id=1%3A836).
- Set up `GitHub Pages` and add a link to the live page in the header of the

## Criteria for work acceptance by the tutor

### Project

**`«A1»`** All styles are contained in one `styles.css` file in the `css`
folder.

**`«A2»`** Source code is formatted with `Prettier`.

**`«A3»`** All images and text content are taken from the layout.

**`«A4»`** All HTML pages have a style normalizer
[`modern-nomalize`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).

**`«A5»`** The code is in line with the [**guide**](https://codeguide.co/).

**`«A6»`** The modal window script is linked in HTML as a separate file,
`modal.js`.

### Markup

**`«B1»`** HTML-markup is done for all layout elements.

**`«B2»`** Tags are used according to their semantics.

### Styling

**`«C1»`** For all hover and focus effects (color, background, shadow),
transitions are made. Time is set to `250ms`, and the timing function is
`cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.

**`«C2»`** Transitions and animations explicitly specify the properties to be
animated. There is no `all` value anywhere.

**`«C3»`** In the `What We Do` section, text with background is positioned over
the image.

**`«C4»`** In the main navigation, the current page's link (which the user is
currently viewing) is underlined using the `::after` pseudo-element.

**`«C5»`** Blue overlay with text appears on the cards of the `Portfolio` page
when hovering over any part of the card.

**`«C6»`** Blue overlay slides out from the bottom of the cards on the
`Portfolio` page, as shown [in the video](./preview.gif).

**`«C7»`** Pseudo-elements have no text content in the `content` property. They
are used exclusively for decorative purposes.

### Modal window

**`«D1»`** The markup and styling of the modal "backdrop" (dark semi-transparent
background) are done.

**`«D2»`** "Backdrop" fills 100% of the height and width of the browser viewport
and stays fixed in it.

**`«D3»`** The markup and styling of the modal window are done.

**`«D4»`** The modal window is vertically and horizontally positioned in the
middle of the backdrop.

**`«D5»`** The markup and styling of the button for closing the modal window in
the upper right corner are done.

**`«D6»`** By default, the modal and backdrop are hidden using the `is-hidden`
class in the backdrop, whose selector uses the `visibility`, `opacity` and
`pointer-events` properties.

**`«D7»`** If you remove the `is-hidden` class from the backdrop, the backdrop
and modal window will appear.

**`«D8»`** The modal window opening/closing is animated using a transition with
an arbitrary effect such as `scale` or `translate`, and `opacity`.

## Modal window opening/closing

A modal window with the order form opens by clicking on the "Order a service"
button. In order for the script to work, you need to add special attributes to
the markup, used by the script to search for elements:

- `data-modal-open` to the button for modal window opening;
- `data-modal-close` to the button for modal window closing;
- `data-modal` to the modal window's backdrop.

Then, before the closing `body` tag, add the `script` tag with a link to the
script file for the modal window.

```html
<body>
  <!-- All you markup, including the modal window -->

  <!-- Place before the body closing tag -->
  <script src="./js/modal.js"></script>
</body>
```

The script to be copied and pasted into the `modal.js` file.

```js
(() => {
  const refs = {
    openModalBtn: document.querySelector('[data-modal-open]'),
    closeModalBtn: document.querySelector('[data-modal-close]'),
    modal: document.querySelector('[data-modal]'),
  };

  refs.openModalBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleModal);
  refs.closeModalBtn.addEventListener('click', toggleModal);

  function toggleModal() {
    refs.modal.classList.toggle('is-hidden');
  }
})();
```
